            5 years ago and encompasses several predecessor companies and the
            inspiring work of 30 people. It is a highly recognized and
            successful conglomerate. Founded in February 2020, Mercurio manages
            wide range or chain and resale supplies under management on behalf
            of over international and institutional clients and suppliers across

            employees spread across the company activities which are divided in
